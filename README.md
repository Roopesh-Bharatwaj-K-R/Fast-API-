# Fast-API-
Python Fast API 

Build an API

We’d like to build a website that anyone can use to retrieve information about Autonomous
System (AS) providers. Your task is to build the API that the website will use.
To power the API, you can use the database offered at: https://iptoasn.com/. You need to
download their database and load it into your API.
Requirements:

● The API needs to have, at least, the following endpoints:
○ Given an AS number, return the AS information
○ Given an IP address (v4 or v6), find the AS that owns the network that the IP
belongs to, and return the AS information
● Use SQLite to store the AS information
